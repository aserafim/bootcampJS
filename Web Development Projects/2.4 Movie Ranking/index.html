    <h1>The Best Movies According to Alefe</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time (or not)</h2>
    
    <hr />

    <h3>Whiplash</h3>
    <p>This is one of my favorites movies. I like so much his screenplay, the actors, the music. Everything in this movie is awesome.</p>

    <h3>The Karate Kid (2009)</h3>
    <p>This movie is starred by Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan. It's a new version of the original one, Karate Kid. I love this movie, because he makes me feel like on the school again, facing the childhood giants.</p>

    <h3>Ghost in the Shell</h3>
    <p>I like this movie, because it's maybe the only anime adaption to the cinema. Most of the original mang√° fans says that this movie is not a good adaption of the original story. But I like it, because it is a well done movie.</p>
